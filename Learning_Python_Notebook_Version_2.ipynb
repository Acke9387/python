Since it is an interpreted language that takes care of many things that would cause other programming languages to throw an error, it is slower to run through the code. Since python is one of the most used languages in data science and scientific computing, there have been many ways created to bypass this downside of python. One way would be to write C/C++ extensions for python compiled in a .pyx file. While this way may provide the fastest running solution, it can be very complex and requires being able to program well in both C and python. For this reason we will save how to do this for a more advanced lesson and look at other ways. The python modules numpy short for numerical python and its scientific extention scipy short for scientific computing allow us to run computations through functions created in C/C++ without having to have a great proficiency in it. Next we will look at how we can use numpy to initialize arrays, perform vector operations, and even how to filter basic signals using a convolutional function. "
